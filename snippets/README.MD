# Snippets

## VS Code Snippets

VS Code Snippets that I use to easily scaffold boilerplate code into files, can be accessed by typing `CTRL+SHIFT+P` OR `CMD+SHIFT+P` and searching for 'Configure User Snippets', and then just placing the json data there on it's respective language file specification.

1. typescript.json
2. typescriptreact.json
