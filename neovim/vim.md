# Vim

# Operators and Motions

- Many comands that change text are made from an operator and a motion.
- Pressing just the motion will move the cursor, and using a count before the motion will move the cursor that many times, or apply the motion that many times.

```vim
d - delete
c - change

d$ - delete to end of line
c$ - change to end of line

dw - delete word
d2w - delete 2 words
d0 - delete to beginning of line
```
